# Functional Specification for MindGarden / Quinn

## 1. Overview

MindGarden is a personal, integrated memory and assistant system designed for one-stop AI needs. It serves as the backbone for storing, retrieving, and processing personal data, documents, and conversation history. Quinn is the friendly, gender-neutral AI assistant that interacts with users via text and voice, orchestrating tasks, retrieving memories, and assisting with daily needs.

## 2. System Architecture

### High-Level Layers

- **User Interface Layer**
  - Voice Interface (STT/TTS via OpenAI)
  - Web/CLI Interface (Gradio, CLI)

- **Core Agent Module (Quinn)**
  - Agent Loop & Orchestration (OpenAI Agent SDK)
  - Tool Integration (custom functions, web search, file access)

- **Integrated Memory & Knowledge Module (KN / MindGarden)**
  - Document Ingestion & Entity Extraction
  - Conversation History
  - Graph Database (Neo4j)

- **Tools & Plugin Layer**
  - Custom Tools

- **Data Storage & Infrastructure**
  - Neo4j Database
  - File System
  - Configuration & Logging

## 3. Functional Requirements
